# bits-pilani-academics
Repo containing all academics-related data from my time at BITS Pilani (2017-2021).

There are three main categories of courses:
- CDCs are the core courses that were mandatory for computer science students.
- Common courses refer to the ones that were mandatory for all engineering students.
- Electives are the courses that were chosen to fulfill requirements other than the ones above.

### Note on Electives:

The elective requirements of my degree were the equivalent of 3 humanities courses,
4 discipline electives and 5-9 open electives. Extra electives done in the first
two categories count towards open electives (OpEls). In my categorisation, I have classified
the courses based on the original requirement it would count towards even if it
actually counted as an OpEl.

The electives are further divided into three sub-categories:
- Computer Science ones are those that count as Discipline Electives (DEls)
- Humanities are the ones that count as Humanities Electives (HuEls)
- Others are the ones that fit in neither category which count as Open Electives (OpEls)
